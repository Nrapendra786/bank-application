# SpringBank

SpringBank is a full-stack application, built with Java and SpringBoot on the backend, and either React or Angular on the frontend (branches available). Its main purpose is to serve as a good starting place for larger projects and to showcase best practices in implementing REST APIs with CRUD functionality, authentication and authorization.
